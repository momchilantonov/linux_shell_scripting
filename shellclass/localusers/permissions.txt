You can use 'chmod' to set some permissions to the user that will use the file.

Example:
chmod 777 <FILENAME>
-rwxrwxrwx
With 777 we set all users permissions - read(r), write(w) and execute(x).
Every group of three symbols(letters) shows what are the rights for every user.
First three are for the admin. Next three are for the sub-admin. Last three are for third part users.
